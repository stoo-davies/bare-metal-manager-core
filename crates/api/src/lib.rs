//! Thin top crate for the `carbide-api` server. Almost nothing lives here — the
//! runtime code is split across two other crates:
//!
//!   - [`carbide_api_core`] — the server itself: the [`Api`]/`Forge` service, the
//!     request handlers, and the core service runtime.
//!   - [`carbide_api_web`] — the admin web UI (the HTML pages under `/admin`).
//!
//! `carbide-api-web` depends on `carbide-api-core` (it needs the [`Api`] type), so
//! `carbide-api-core` can't depend back on `carbide-api-web` — that would be a
//! dependency cycle. But *something* has to know about both in order to hand the
//! web pages to the server at startup. That's this crate's whole job: it's the one
//! place allowed to depend on both, so the wiring happens here (see `main.rs`).
//!
//! This crate owns process bootstrap and exports [`run`] so that the
//! `carbide-api` binary and integration tests have one stable entrypoint.
